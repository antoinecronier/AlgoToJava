/**
 * In stations and airports you often see this type of screen. Have you ever
 * asked yourself how it might be possible to simulate this display on a good
 * old terminal? We have: with ASCII art!
 *
 * ASCII art allows you to represent forms by using characters. To be precise,
 * in our case, these forms are words. For example, the word "MANHATTAN" could
 * be displayed as follows in ASCII art: # # # ### # # # ### ### # ### ### # # #
 * # # # # # # # # # # # ### ### # # ### ### # # ### # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
 * # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # â€‹Your mission is to write a program
 * that can display a line of text in ASCII art.
 *
 * INPUT: Line 1: the width L of a letter represented in ASCII art. All letters
 * are the same width. Line 2: the height H of a letter represented in ASCII
 * art. All letters are the same height. Line 3: The line of text T, composed of
 * N ASCII characters. Following Lines: the string of characters
 * ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ? Represented in ASCII art.
 *
 * OUTPUT: The text T in ASCII art. The characters a to z are shown in ASCII art
 * by their equivalent in upper case. The characters which are not in the
 * intervals [a-z] or [A-Z] will be shown as a question mark in ASCII art.
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS : 0 < L < 30 0 < H < 30 0 < N < 200
